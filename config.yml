    Content: >
      This site was created to celebrate [the 2500 anniversary of the Battle of Thermopylae](https://thermopylae2500.wordpress.com/about/) together with the [Hellenic Society](https://www.hellenicsociety.org.uk/). It presents a research project *Sparta in Polish Literature and Culture â€“ from the Old Polish Period to the 20th Century: Between the Reception of Greek Heritage and the Search for National Identity* and discusses the central role of Thermopylae in the Polish reception of Sparta.
