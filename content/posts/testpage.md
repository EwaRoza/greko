Volume two of Sparta w kulturze polskiej [Sparta in Polish Culture] completes our presentation of the results of research conducted at the University of Warsaw’s Faculty of ‘Artes Liberales’ in the inter-university project Sparta in Polish Literature and Culture from the Old Polish Period to the 20th Century: Between the Reception of Greek Heritage and the Search for National Identity (financed with National Science Centre (NCN) funding). The project’s aim was to explore the vision of Sparta in Polish literature and culture from the earliest times – the Old Polish period – all the way to the present era. The project covered all of the Polish literary periods and the most important traces of the Polish reception of Sparta, considered in the broad context of Polish and European culture.
