Romanticism had exerted a huge influence on all subsequent periods of Polish culture and on the Polish national consciousness. Romantic literature was written at a time of national bondage, which made its function very special: it was charged with upholding national identity and often replacing institutions that did not exist in the enslaved society. 

Polish Romanticism also had a decisive influence on the reception of the topic of Thermopylae in modern Polish culture. Sparta in Polish culture is strongly associated with the Thermopylae motif, which symbolizes allegiance to a lost cause and has a very positive dimension in Polish Romanticism and post-Romanticism. 

Here we present the motifs of Thermopylae and Sparta in three stages: 
•	in Juliusz Słowacki’s (1809-1849) poetry, the influence of which is exceptionally strong on the national imagination
•	in Stanisław Wyspianski’s (1869-1907) dramas 
•	in Zbigniew Herbert’s (1924-1998) poetry, which was important to the independent intelligentsia during the communist regime.
