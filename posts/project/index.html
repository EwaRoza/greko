The project’s aim was to explore the vision of Sparta in Polish literature and culture from the earliest times – the Old Polish period – all the way to the present era. The project covered all of the Polish literary periods and the most important traces of the Polish reception of Sparta, considered in the broad context of Polish and European culture.\nThe two volumes of Sparta w kulturze polskiej constitute the first monographic study on this topic, enabling the Polish reception of Spartan themes to be reconstructed and its distinct and unique character to be described against a European background. At the same time, it needs saying that we have not exhausted or closed this subject matter, but only outlined issues that are sure to inspire researchers to conduct further studies in this area.\nOf course, the most important question that has emerged in the context of our several-year research concerns the character of the Polish reception of Sparta, where the term “reception of Sparta” is a catchphrase for a number of issues from the realms of literature and the arts, history of political thought, and anthropological and didactic concepts that recur in the history of European culture, forming its main intellectual, anthropological, social and political trends. What image of the Polish reception of Sparta emerges from our research and the two-volume publication presenting the results? What are the unique features of the Polish vision of Lacedaemon? Can we formulate such a hypothesis on the basis of these studies? Which of the “Spartan” themes that comprise the European myth of Sparta have dominated the Polish image of this city-state? Was there continuity in the Polish reception of Sparta in the pre-partition period and during the partitions? Did the 20th century in any way revise the earlier Polish myth of Sparta?\nBoth volumes of Sparta w kulturze polskiej provide extensive material for deliberation on these questions, and we believe that the monographic character of our publication provides some answers as well. It needs adding, however, that this is a special kind of monograph, featuring multiple voices and many perspectives, since we have done our best to consider the “Polish Sparta” from many different viewpoints, both in the sense of the individual approaches of the researchers, who represent different areas of knowledge and different methodologies, and with respect to different contexts, which we have summoned in order to see this Polish uniqueness against a European background even more clearly. We value the kind of monographic work that does not paint a monolithic image and does not arise from a one-sided approach, but gives proper consideration to the complexity and multidimensionality of the humanist reality constantly being uncovered and involved in different interpretive orders. Thus presented, the Polish reception of Sparta functions within tensions long established in the Polish humanities and defining different understandings of Polish culture and its history.\nAnother opposition affecting the image of the “Polish Sparta” is the essentially unresolvable debate over the continuity/discontinuity of the culture of free Poland and Poland in bondage. The present volume contains different positions on this issue too: from those underlining the nation’s completely different cultural situation after the loss of freedom as a result of partitioning, to those highlighting the continuity of cultural tradition.\nA different tension influencing the Polish image of Sparta stems from the more general identification of the predominant model in Polish culture: is it non-Romantic or Romantic? Is Romanticism the most important formation for Polish culture and mentality, is it the exemplar that has defined models of national behaviours? Or, perhaps there exist, and are still relevant today, cultural models that are alternative in relation to Romanticism, especially those which originated from the pre-partition world (let us add: and are concretised and named in various ways, e.g. classicism, Sarmatism…)? In this case we are going back to old disputes over the most important formation that decides about the peculiarity of Polish culture… These are essentially unresolvable disputes, but they have a decisive impact on our choice of perspective in viewing humanist content, including the reconstruction of the image of Sparta. In this order, the importance of Agamemnon’s Tomb, for example, is unsurpassed, while Słowacki’s deep, almost organic Hellenism has an incredible capacity to radiate to and influence successive generations.\nHow does the Polish reception of Thermopylae relate to the Polish reception of Sparta?\nContents of Volumes: Contents of Volume I  Ryszard Kulesza, Two Spartas.
