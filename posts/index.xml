      <description>Volume two of Sparta w kulturze polskiej [Sparta in Polish Culture] completes our presentation of the results of research conducted at the University of Warsaw’s Faculty of ‘Artes Liberales’ in the inter-university project Sparta in Polish Literature and Culture from the Old Polish Period to the 20th Century: Between the Reception of Greek Heritage and the Search for National Identity (financed with National Science Centre (NCN) funding).

      <title>Thermopylae: – questioning, criticism, re-assessments</title>

      <description>In Polish culture, Thermopylae is usually associated with a positive model of war heroism. However, at times references to the famous battle were also used critically, to show that the model of heroism it embodies is simplistic, defective, or inadequate. In this part of the site, I will shortly introduce the typical realization of the Thermopylae theme in Polish war poetry, and then I will discuss several attempts to transgress it: the poem of Tadeusz Różewicz “Polish Thermopylae” as well as an identically entitled play of Tadeusz Miciński and its more recent interpretations.</description>
