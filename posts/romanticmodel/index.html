Romantic literature was written at a time of national bondage, which made its function very special: it was charged with upholding national identity and often replacing institutions that did not exist in the enslaved society.\nPolish Romanticism also had a decisive influence on the reception of the topic of Thermopylae in modern Polish culture. Sparta in Polish culture is strongly associated with the Thermopylae motif, which symbolizes allegiance to a lost cause and has a very positive dimension in Polish Romanticism and post-Romanticism.\nHere we present the motifs of Thermopylae and Sparta in three stages: •\tin Juliusz Słowacki’s (1809-1849) poetry, the influence of which is exceptionally strong on the national imagination •\tin Stanisław Wyspianski’s (1869-1907) dramas •\tin Zbigniew Herbert’s (1924-1998) poetry, which was important to the independent intelligentsia during the communist regime.\nSparta in the “Greek” works of Juliusz Słowacki and Stanisław Wyspiański (M. Kalinowska, Sparta w dialogach “greckich” dzieł Juliusza Słowackiego i Stanisława Wyspiańskiego (próba sformułowania pytań), in: Sparta w kulturze polskiej, vol. 1, Warszawa 2014, Wydział Artes Liberales UW, SubLupa, p. 197-218).\nSparta appears in Słowacki’s oeuvre on numerous occasions and in different ways. It appears in Agamemnon’s Tomb (1838) with its central theme of Thermopylae and the heroism of Leonidas. This poem is among the most significant works of Polish Romanticism and has had a tremendous influence upon the generations that followed. The poet travelling across Greece, visits Mycenae and Thermopylae. Mycenae makes him think about the problem of evil in history, whereas Thermopylae represents an unattable model of heroism. The monumental figure of Leonidas personifies this heroism.\nIn Agamemnon’s Tomb there is an unusual fragment: “And for a long time the people cried because of such a sacrifice”, “The scented fire and broken goblet” (v. 89-90). This mysterious metaphor suggests a romantic ritual of Forefathers’ Eve (the encounter with one’s dead ancestors – the central motif of Polish Romanticism): the people who are present at the sacrifice, the people as witnesses to this Thermopylae sacrifice, and the poet who, on the battlefields, calls on the ghosts of the old Greek heroes and talks to them as though they are still alive and present for him ([…] they must be there […] they still see, v. 75). “The Legion of the Dead Spartans\" is still present at Thermopilae and it is “at the grave” that they show to the travelling poet “their bodies in blood”. They ask the poet who came “from the sad land of the Helots”, that is from the land of slaves, about a common or similar history: “[…] they even ask, ‘Were there many of you?’”- This question refers to the failed Polish national uprising of 1830.\nIn Agamemnon’s Tomb Leonidas is presented as a naked statue, and this is a specific kind of nakedness characteristic of ancient Greek monuments. It merges the indestructible divine and the eternal with human physicality and sensuality. There is a beautiful soul in this marble statue and a struggle is being waged for it and its spiritual strength. A Poland bathed in the River Styx can become such a statue, and can regain its soul.\nGrażyna Halkiewicz-Sojak, Zbigniew Herbert’s Sparta ","wordCount":"545","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-11-06T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2020-11-06T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Maria Kalinowska"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://ewaroza.github.io/sparta/posts/romanticmodel/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Sparta","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://ewaroza.github.io/sparta/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=single id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>.theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://ewaroza.github.io/sparta/ accesskey=h><img src=/sparta/apple-touch-icon.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a>
